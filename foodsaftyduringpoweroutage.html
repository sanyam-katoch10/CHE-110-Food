        <h2>Refrigerated Food and Power Outages: When to Save It and When to Throw It Out</h2>
        <p>As the USDA notes in Keeping Food Safe During an Emergency, your refrigerator will keep food safe for up to 4 hours during a power outage. Keep the door closed as much as possible. Discard refrigerated perishable food such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and leftovers after 4 hours without power.

            After a power outage never taste food to determine its safety. You will have to evaluate each item separately—use this chart as a guide. When in Doubt, Throw it Out!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible to maintain the cold temperature.</li>
            <li>Place perishable items in a cooler with ice packs to keep them cold.</li>
        </ul>
